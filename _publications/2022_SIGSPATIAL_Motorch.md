Motorch includes a server for cases processing and a mobile application for personal trajectory management. In the server, we utilize a web crawler to collect COVID-19 text data from news websites and extract visits over POIs (Point of Interests). In the application, raw trajectories are collected by a GPS module and transformed into POI-matched trajectories.
